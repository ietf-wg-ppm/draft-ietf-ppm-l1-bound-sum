where the sum of the values in the contribution is less than a chosen value.

# Introduction

Existing Prio instantiations of a Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Function (VDAF)
{{!VDAF=I-D.irtf-cfrg-vdaf}}
all support a simple summation of measurements.
From Prio3Count ({{Section 7.4.1 of VDAF}}),
which adds measurements containing a single one or a zero value,
to Prio3SumVec ({{Section 7.4.3 of VDAF}}),
which adds measurements containing an vector where each dimension is a limited number of bits,
all instantations take the same basic form.

One case that is presently not included in the suite of instantiations
is the addition of vectors or histogram contributions,
where each measurement has an L1 bound.
The L1 norm of a vector is defined as the sum of its components.
An L1 bound limits that sum to some maximum.

This document defines the Prio3L1BoundSum instantiation.
This instantiation limits the L1 norm of a vector or histogram
to a value that is one less than a chosen power of 2,
or 2<sup>n</sup>-1.
This choice significantly reduces the size of the encoding
relative to a more flexible limit.

This instantiation has similarities with other instantiations.
Unlike Prio3Histogram ({{Section 7.4.4 of VDAF}}),
in which measurements need to have an L1 norm of exactly 1,
a valid measurement for Prio3L1BoundSum can have an L1 norm equal to any value
between 0 and the chosen limit.
Unlike Prio3MultiHotCountVec ({{Section 7.4.5 of VDAF}}),
in which each component can only be zero or one,
components in Prio3L1BoundSum can take any value up to the L1 bound
as long as their sum is within that bound.

{{def}} defines the Prio3L1BoundSum VDAF.

# Prio3L1BoundSum Definition {#def}

The Prio3L1BoundSum instantiation of Prio {{?PRIO=DOI.10.5555/3154630.3154652}}
supports the addition of a vector of integers.
The instantiation is summarized in {{table-l1-bound-sum}}.

| Parameter | Value |
|:-|:-|
| field | Field128 ({{Section 6.1.2 of VDAF}}) |
| Valid | L1BoundSum(field, length, bits, chunk_length) |
| PROOFS | 1 |
| XOF | XofTurboShake128 ({{Section 6.2.1 of VDAF}}) |
{: #table-l1-bound-sum title="Prio3L1BoundSum Parameters"}

The function takes three parameters:
`length`, `bits`, and `chunk_length`.
The vector contains "`length`" components,
each of which is a non-negative integer less than 2<sup>`bits`</sup>.


## Chunk Length Selection

The `chunk_length` parameter can be chosen
in approximately the same way as for Prio3SumVec,
as detailed in {{Section 7.4.3.1 of VDAF}}.
The difference is that Prio3L1BoundSum involves validation of
`bits * (length + 1)` values,
which might increase the most efficient value for `chunk_length`.


## Encoding and Decoding

The encoded form of each measurement appends a bitwise decomposition
of the L1 norm (the sum of the vector components) to the encoding:

~~~ python
def encode(self, measurement: list[int]) -> list[F]:
    encoded = []
    weight = self.field(0)
    for v in measurement:
        weight += v
        encoded += self.field.encode_into_bit_vector(v, self.bits)
    w_bits = self.field.encode_into_bit_vector(weight, self.bits)
    return encoded + w_bits
~~~

The encoded measurement has a total length of `(length + 1) * bits`.

This extra information is not included in the measurement
that is submitted for aggregation.
That is, the `truncate()` function emits only the core measurements.

~~~ python
def truncate(self, meas: list[F]) -> list[F]:
    return [
       self.field.decode_from_bit_vector(m)
       for m in chunks(meas, self.bits)
    ]
~~~

This uses a `chunks(v, c)` function that takes a list of values, `v`,
and a chunk length, `c`,
to split `v` into multiple lists from `v`,
where each chunk has a length `c`.

The `decode()` function is therefore identical to that in Prio3SumVec.

~~~ python
def decode(self, output: list[F], _count) -> list[int]:
    return [x.as_unsigned() for x in output)
~~~


## Validity Circuit

The validity circuit for Prio3L1BoundSum uses an extended version
of the validity circuit used by Prio3SumVec,
see {{Section 7.4.3 of VDAF}}.

The encoded measurement is checked
to ensure that every component of the vector –
plus the added L1 norm –
is encoded in the specified number of bits.
That is, the circuit checks that each component has a value between
0 (inclusive) and 2<sup>`bits`</sup> (exclusive)
by checking that each of the first "`bits`" bits of the value
are either zero or one.
This process is identical to the Prio3SumVec check,
except that one additional value is checked.

The validity circuit then checks whether the added L1 norm value
is consistent with the encoded vector elements.
The L1 norm is checked by decoding the measurement values,
including the encoded L1 norm,
recomputing the L1 norm as the sum of the individual components, and
subtracting the reported and computed values
to confirm that they are identical.

The complete circuit is specified in {{fig-eval}}.

~~~ python
def eval(self, meas: list[F],
         joint_rand: list[F], num_shares: int) -> list[F]:
    assert len(meas) == (self.length + 1) * self.bits
    shares_inv = self.field(num_shares).inv()
    parallel_sum = ParallelSum(Mul(), chunk_length)

    num_chunks = ceil(len(meas) / self.chunk_length)
    pad_len = self.chunk_length * num_chunks - len(meas)
    meas += [self.field(0)] * pad_len

    range_check = self.field(0)
    for (r, m) in zip(joint_rand, chunks(meas, self.chunk_length)):
        inputs = []
        for i in range(self.chunk_length):
            inputs += [
                r**(i + 1) * m[i],
                m[i] - shares_inv,
            ]
        range_check += parallel_sum.eval(self.field, inputs)

    components = [
        self.field.decode_from_bit_vector(m)
        for m in chunks(meas, self.bits)
    ]
    observed_weight = sum(components[:self.length])
    claimed_weight = components[self.length]
    weight_check = observed_weight - claimed_weight

    return [range_check, weight_check]

# Security Considerations

The Prio3L1BoundSum VDAF is subject to the same considerations as other Prio-based VDAFs.
These considerations are detailed in {{Section 9 of VDAF}}.

In particular, this instantiation uses Field128 to ensure robustness
despite the use of joint randomness in proofs.
Joint randomness increases the risk of an attacker finding
a combination of invalid inputs that passes validation.
A larger field increases the computational cost
of finding such a combination.
