1.  Introduction

   Existing Prio instantiations of a Verifiable Distributed Aggregation
   Function (VDAF) [VDAF] all support a simple summation of
   measurements.  From Prio3Count (Section 7.4.1 of [VDAF]), which adds
   measurements containing a single one or a zero value, to Prio3SumVec
   (Section 7.4.3 of [VDAF]), which adds measurements containing an
   vector where each dimension is a limited number of bits, all
   instantations take the same basic form.

   One case that is presently not included in the suite of
   instantiations is the addition of vectors or histogram contributions,
   where each measurement has an L1 bound.  The L1 norm of a vector is
   defined as the sum of its components.  An L1 bound limits that sum to
   some maximum.

   This document defines the Prio3L1BoundSum instantiation.  Unlike
   Prio3Histogram (Section 7.4.4 of [VDAF]), in which measurements need
   to have an L1 norm of exactly 1, a valid measurement for
   Prio3L1BoundSum can have an L1 norm equal to any value between 0 and
   the chosen limit.

   This instantiation limits the L1 norm of a vector or histogram to a
   value that is one less than a chosen power of 2, or 2^n-1.  This
   choice significantly reduces the size of the encoding relative to a
   more flexible limit.

   Section 3 defines the encoding of measurements for this instantiation
   and how the validation function is evaluated.

   of [VDAF].

3.  Prio3L1BoundSum Definition

   The Prio3L1BoundSum instantiation of Prio [PRIO] supports the
   addition of a vector of integers.  The instantiation is summarized in
   Table 1.

                   Table 1: Prio3L1BoundSum Parameters

   The function takes three parameters: length, bits, and chunk_length.
   The vector contains "length" components, each of which is a non-
   negative integer less than 2^bits.

3.1.  Chunk Length Choice

   The chunk_length parameter can be chosen in approximately the same
   way as for Prio3SumVec, as detailed in Section 7.4.3.1 of [VDAF].
   The difference is that Prio3L1BoundSum involves validation of bits *
   (length + 1) values, which might increase the most efficient value
   for chunk_length.

3.2.  Validity Circuit

   The validity circuit for Prio3L1BoundSum uses a modified version of
   the Prio3SumVec validity circuit, see Section 7.4.3 of [VDAF].

   The values from the measurement are extended to include their sum, so
   that the sum is checked in the same way as each vector component.
   The encoded measurement has a total length of (length + 1) * bits.
   The field elements in the encoded vector represent all the bits of
   the measurement vector's elements, followed by the bits of the L1
   norm of the vector.

   The validity circuit checks that the encoded measurement consists of
   ones and zeros, and that the encoded L1 norm is consistent with the
   encoded vector elements.  The first checks, that all field elements
   are ones and zeros, are done in the same manner as in the SumVec
   circuit.  The L1 norm is checked by decoding the reported L1 norm,
   decoding the measurement vector, recomputing the L1 norm, and
   subtracting to confirm they are identical.

   The complete circuit is specified below.

   class L1BoundSum(Valid[list[int], list[int], F]):
       EVAL_OUTPUT_LEN = 2

4.  Security Considerations

   The Prio3L1BoundSum VDAF is subject to the same considerations as
   other Prio-based VDAFs.  These considerations are detailed in
   Section 9 of [VDAF].

   In particular, this instantiation uses Field128 to ensure robustness
   despite the use of joint randomness in proofs.  Joint randomness
   increases the risk of an attacker finding a combination of invalid
   inputs that passes validation.  A larger field increases the
   computational cost of finding such a combination.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a codepoint for Prio3L1BoundSum in the
   "Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Functions (VDAF)" registry as
   defined by Section 10 of [VDAF].  This entry contains the following
   fields:

   Value:  0xTBD
   Scheme:  Prio3L1BoundSum
